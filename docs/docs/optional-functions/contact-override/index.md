Place the Prefab in the hierarchy, and deploy it inside "FaceEmoPrefab".  
When you upload the avatar in this state, the expression will be overwritten when another player's hand touches your head.

If "FaceEmoPrefab" does not exist within the avatar, please first apply the facial expression menu to the avatar.
